# Dataset

Need to pick a dataset from below:

[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)


# Data Mining software

Please use [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)


# TODO

## Report

1. Performance
> TAR: True Accept Rate

> TRR: True Reject Rate

> FAR: False Accept Rate

> FRR: False Reject Rate

> HTER: (FAR+FRR)/2)

2. Execution time for training and testing phases


# Note:

For GPU implementation, you should use OpenCL [here](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) which allows offloading to mobile GPU. The kernel code will be in C/C++ and it will use android NDK [here](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html) to execute with the app.
